### Hello, I'm Shweta Kamble üëã

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and making an impact through creative solutions. 
Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## üõ† Projects

### *Bookshop Management System*  

*OVERVIEW:*  


Inventory Management:
Book Catalog: A detailed list of books available in the shop, with information such as title, author, publisher, genre, price, and stock levels.
Stock Management: Tracks the number of copies of each book in the store, and alerts when stock is low or needs to be reordered.

Sales Management:
Point of Sale (POS): Allows cashiers to process book sales quickly, generating invoices or receipts. The system calculates prices, applies discounts, and handles payments (cash, card, or digital).
Sales Reports: Generates reports on sales performance, daily transactions, or specific book sales. It helps analyze trends and monitor sales goals.

Customer Management:
Customer Database: Keeps track of customer information such as names, contact details, and purchase history. This can help personalize marketing campaigns or promotions.
Loyalty Programs: Allows for the implementation of loyalty programs, where customers earn points or rewards for repeat purchases.

 Purchase and Ordering:
Purchase Orders: The system helps create orders for restocking based on current inventory levels. It tracks orders placed with suppliers, their status, and the expected delivery dates.
Automatic Reordering: Some systems can automatically reorder books based on predefined stock thresholds or sales trends.

*Technical Stack:*  

- *Languages:* C++ 
- *Algorithms:* Dijkstra‚Äôs, linear search,binary search,merge sorting,quick sort, Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
- *Tools:* Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques  

*Impact:*  
- *Improved Efficiency and Productivity
Automation of Routine Tasks: A BMS automates tedious processes like inventory tracking, sales processing, and generating invoices. This reduces manual errors and the time spent on repetitive tasks.
Faster Checkout Process: Cashiers can process transactions more quickly, enhancing customer satisfaction by reducing wait times at the point of sale.
Simplified Inventory Management: The system provides real-time tracking of stock levels, automated reordering, and alerts when inventory is low. This minimizes stockouts and overstocking, optimizing storage and procurement.
- *Enhanced Customer Experience
Personalized Service: Customer data, such as purchase history and preferences, can be used to recommend books, run loyalty programs, or send personalized offers, improving customer loyalty and engagement.
Faster and More Accurate Transactions: Automated sales processing ensures accuracy in billing, discounts, and taxes, making transactions smooth and error-free.
Availability of Products: With effective inventory management, customers are more likely to find the books they are looking for, even if they request a specific title, reducing the likelihood of lost sales.
- *Data-Driven Decision Making
Sales and Inventory Analytics: The BMS generates detailed reports that give insights into best-selling titles, customer preferences, and trends. This helps bookshop owners make better purchasing decisions and plan promotions more effectively.
Financial Insights: Real-time access to financial data helps managers understand cash flow, profit margins, and cost structures, enabling better budgeting and financial planning.
Performance Tracking: The system can track key performance indicators (KPIs), such as sales growth, customer retention, and stock turnover rates, offering a clear picture of business¬†health.
